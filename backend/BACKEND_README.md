# Setting up the backend for local development

1. If you haven't already, set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` in /backend
2. Initialize the environment: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Install the required dependencies if there are any `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the server `python server.py` and you can interact with the endpoint: `localhost:5000/response`
